Directory layout and collection of batch scripts for the Windows Command
Prompt.

Description of the directory layout (compared to the Filesystem Hierarchy
Standard FHS):

    Config          configuration files (like 'etc')
    Exec            executables, mainly batch scripts (like 'bin')
    Exec\Support    internal executables that are not intended to be
                    executed directly by users (like 'libexec')

Environment setup: Run 'Exec\Support\cmdinit.bat'.  Among other things,
this sets up the PATH environment variable to include the 'Exec'
directory.  With a registry entry, the Windows Command Promot (cmd.exe)
can be configured to load this script automatically, see the source of
'cmdinit.bat' for details.
